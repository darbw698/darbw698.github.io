                Covid Diaries, is a diary entry site where people can talk about their life during these hardtimes,
                being isolated to protect ourseleves from Covid-19. I found myself watching how much of what I do is
                what I do every single day and I know I am not alone and I know I would like to hear how ours are
                feeling and doing. With these promoted diary entries everyone is able to write about their lives.
