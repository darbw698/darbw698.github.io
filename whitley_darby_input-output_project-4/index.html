            Covid Diaries, is a diary entry site where people can talk about their life during these hardtimes,
            being isolated to protect ourseleves from Covid-19. I found myself watching how much of what I do is
            what I do every single day. I know I am not alone and I know I would like to hear how ours are
            feeling and doing too. With these promoted diary entries everyone is able to write about their lives during Covid 19.
