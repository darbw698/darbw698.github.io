                            <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has
                                yet to begin a life who will not end it.

                                In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot
                                even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches
                                fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a
                                poem without an end. <svg class="icon" data-name="red-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 144 144"><defs><style>.cls-1{fill:#e77865;}</style></defs><path class="cls-1" d="M74.57,40.29c-20.37,0-36.88,12.81-36.88,28.62,0,7.22,3.46,13.82,9.15,18.86A27.76,27.76,0,0,1,41,100.22c-2.43,2.88-4.6,4.13-4.27,4.71.66,1.17,10.66-2.61,19.45-8.17,1.12-.7,2.07-1.35,2.85-1.89a46,46,0,0,0,15.54,2.66c20.37,0,36.88-12.82,36.88-28.62S94.94,40.29,74.57,40.29Z"/></svg>

                                Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that
                                every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for
                                where quotations begin is in a cloud.
                            </p>

                                Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so
                                accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like
                                finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and
                                the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.

                                In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet
                                there
                                is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that
                                nothing
                                can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before
                                some kind of act.

                                I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of
                                a
                                poem than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it
                                begins
                                off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against
                                our
                                own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic

                                    what we thought off in our mind at the time, the ending is when we write that poem on a piece of paper,
                                    tablet, or computer. although I think that isn't the end considering she talks about where the poem ends up

                                state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love
                                to
                                wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to
                                exist!
                                To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by
                                Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign,
                                impersonate.
                                That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has
                                been
                                from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet

                                angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird
                                theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only
                                instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that
                                you
                                draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words,
                                self-consciousness is theatre.

                                Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always
                                the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen,
                                heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets
                                recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any
                                idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley,
                                at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be
                                learned by trial and error.

                                I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell
                                it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea. <svg class="icon" data-name="red-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 144 144"><defs><style>.cls-1{fill:#e77865;}</style></defs><path class="cls-1" d="M74.57,40.29c-20.37,0-36.88,12.81-36.88,28.62,0,7.22,3.46,13.82,9.15,18.86A27.76,27.76,0,0,1,41,100.22c-2.43,2.88-4.6,4.13-4.27,4.71.66,1.17,10.66-2.61,19.45-8.17,1.12-.7,2.07-1.35,2.85-1.89a46,46,0,0,0,15.54,2.66c20.37,0,36.88-12.82,36.88-28.62S94.94,40.29,74.57,40.29Z"/></svg>

                                Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a
                                standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million
                                three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what
                                Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English
                                among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence
                                begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words
                                right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant
                                vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and
                                loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.

                                When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of
                                semicolons!” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and
                                resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the
                                way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be
                                thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a
                                matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all
                                apparent purposes is unrelated.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to
                                the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the
                                first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that
                                intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other,
                                not you to them or they to you.

                                I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words
                                come on the screen and say: The End. I miss finishing a novel and there on the last
                                page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark
                                letters spelling The End.

                                It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a
                                deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and
                                the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that, I
                                wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that
                                there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across
                                the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in
                                the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the
                                rest of the text, were the words The End. And I realized children very often denote the
                                end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they
                                are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been
                                written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they
                                are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and
                                stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing.

                                Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending
                                will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a
                                pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent.

                                Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in
                                admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the
                                experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the
                                moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; the
                                least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through
                                familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think
                                about it.

                                I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you
                                believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.

                                The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot
                                be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”

                            </p>

                                Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his
                                drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written
                                long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.

                                Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings).

                                The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a
                                see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell.

                                Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this:
                                “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or
                                states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most
                                gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or,
                                to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that
                                those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be
                                traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like
                                tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning,
                                before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning
                                because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing”
                                itself was born.

                                I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across
                                ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first lines
                                are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even
                                repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words
                                belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading these first and
                                last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we
                                each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to
                                use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that
                                beginning and that end are the same: in poem after poem I encountered words that mark
                                the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after
                                night, like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.
                                And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope
                                to hear on earth: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.

                                But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s
                                last words (in a letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound,
                                cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it
                                was finally time to go in. And it was.
